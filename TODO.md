# To-Do

- make it look good
- player view
    - show title
    - show progress
    - show volume
    - allow play pause
    - allow volume change
    - allow seek
- debug view
- add seek binds in the player page

# Ideas

- queue support 
    - (search WHILE playing append to playlist)
    - queue controll binds
- youtube playlist support
- find and show lyrics
- other sources? (maybe soundcloud?)
- quick access (saved songs)
- add CLI mode (instead of TUI, cobra?)
