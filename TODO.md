# To-Do

- add "recovery" to prevent random crashes that aren't logged
- create "models" (or something like that) package
- refact the search results page
- handle playlist empty
- show player status (play/paused, duration, position)
- add play/pause binds in the player page
- add stop binds in the player page
- add volume binds in the player page
- add seek binds in the player page

# Ideas

- find and show lyrics
- other sources? (maybe soundcloud?)
- quick access
- ğŸ”´liveğŸ”´ support?
- use cobra?
- add CLI mode (instead of TUI)
